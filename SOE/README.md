# Homage - Automated - Microsoft Windows 11 - SOE / Template for Proxmox

This is my Windows 11 development environment for Vibe coding, which I call Homage, in honor of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/). It even includes US DoD Windows 11 STIG security and a lot of other tweaks. I also have a Proxmox helper script to set up Omarchy as well! A true Viber code environment with Windows, Linux, and macOS all at once. Here comes a Salesforce clone, Lez Go!

I plan to put this behind a secure firewall/DMZ with everything configured so I can invite other developers via Parsec.app without them being able to access or steal any code. I can also access this remotely and continue my Vibe coding adventures from my Mac laptop. THe reason for this, I do am interested in allot of different things and some of them only run on specific operating systems, so this, why, I have virtulized, Linux, Windows, MacOS and even iOS for testing. I am running all of this on a single workstation, nowdays CPU, and M.2 is so fast and cheap. I have about 20 machines all at once and don't even have any performacne issues. cray cray.

## Windows 11 for Vibe Codeing

This is my SOE (Standard Operating Environment) for Windows 11, which can be built on Proxmox. I use this as the base for my primary Windows Vibe code development environment and testing.

VirtIO provides better performance in virtualized environments. SATA and Realtek work without extra drivers but add emulation overhead, which slows performance. VirtIO is purpose-built for VMs, so disk and network I/O are much faster. If you can install the drivers, the performance gain is worth it.
